# Console_PhoneBook
Console contacts management application developed in C#

FEATURES:

1.Add Contact: Allow users to add new contacts to the phonebook. They should be able to input the contact's name, phone number, email address, and any other relevant information.

2.View All Contacts: Provide an option to display a list of all contacts stored in the phonebook. This list should show basic information such as names and phone numbers.

3.Search Contacts: Allow users to search for specific contacts by name, phone number, or any other relevant criteria. Provide a search functionality that returns matching contacts.

4.Edit Contact: Allow users to modify existing contact information. They should be able to update the name, phone number, email address, and any other details associated with a contact.

5.Delete Contact: Implement the ability to delete contacts from the phonebook. Users should be able to remove unwanted or outdated contacts from the database.

6.Save/Load Contacts: Implement functionality to save the phonebook data to a file (e.g., a text file or a database) so that it can be loaded again later. This ensures that contacts are persisted between sessions.

7.Import/Export Contacts: Provide options to import contacts from external sources (e.g., CSV files, vCard files) and export contacts to various formats for backup or sharing purposes.

8.Sort Contacts: Allow users to sort the list of contacts based on different criteria such as name, phone number, or date added. This helps users quickly find the contact they are looking for.

9.Pagination: If the list of contacts is long, implement pagination or scrolling functionality to display a subset of contacts at a time, improving usability and performance.

10.User Interface Enhancements: Consider adding user-friendly features such as color-coding, interactive menus, and keyboard shortcuts to enhance the user experience.

11.Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle unexpected situations such as invalid input, file I/O errors, or database connectivity issues.

12.Data Validation: Validate user input to ensure that contact information is entered correctly and consistently. Provide feedback to users if any errors are detected.

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
